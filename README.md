WMATA Watch
==========

## What It Is

WMATA Watch is a mobile-first web application that displays arrival predictions for every WMATA metro rail station all in one place.

## How It Works

The application is entirely browser-based and does not use a custom backend.

- Data comes from [WMATA's API](http://developer.wmata.com/io-docs)
- Site pulls data from the API and live updates results on page using AngularJS
- Foundation framework used for responsive layout

## Future Features

- Save favorite stations for quick access
- Predicted arrival times for buses
